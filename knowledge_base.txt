Company Overview:
HelpBot supports ACME Shop, an online retailer of consumer accessories and apparel.
Our mission is to deliver fast shipping, transparent policies, and responsive support.

Shipping Policy:
Standard shipping typically takes 3–5 business days after the order is processed.
Expedited shipping (if selected) takes 1–2 business days. Processing time is usually under 24 hours on business days.
We currently ship domestically only (no international addresses or PO Boxes).
You will receive a tracking link via email once the carrier scans the package.
If tracking shows "Delivered" but you did not receive the package, wait 24 hours and then contact support.

Returns & Exchanges:
Customers may return most items within 30 days of delivery. Items must be unused, unwashed, and in original packaging with all tags attached.
Non‑returnable items: gift cards, final sale/clearance items, and perishable goods.
To initiate a return, contact support with your order ID. You will receive a prepaid label.
Refunds are issued to the original payment method within 5 business days after the warehouse inspection.
Exchanges: Specify the new size/color; if unavailable, a refund is issued instead.
Late returns (beyond 30 days) may be rejected or refunded as store credit at our discretion.

Warranty:
Electronics and wearable devices include a 1‑year limited warranty covering manufacturing defects.
Warranty does not cover accidental damage, misuse, or normal wear and tear.
To file a warranty claim, provide photos, a description of the defect, and proof of purchase.

Payments:
We accept major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express), PayPal, and ACME gift cards.
At this time we do not support cash on delivery, bank transfers, “buy now pay later” services, or cryptocurrency.
Only one promotional code can be applied per order. Gift cards may be combined with promo codes.
Charges are captured at the time of order placement.

Sales Tax:
Applicable sales tax is calculated based on the shipping address and displayed at checkout.
Tax‑exempt organizations should contact support before placing an order.

Order Issues:
If your tracking status has not updated for 5 consecutive business days, contact support for an investigation.
Damaged items must be reported within 48 hours of delivery with photos of packaging and product.
Missing items: verify the packing slip; some orders ship in multiple boxes. Contact support if not received within 2 days of other items.

Order Modifications & Cancellations:
We cannot guarantee modifications once an order is submitted because it enters automated processing quickly.
If the package has not yet shipped, we will attempt cancellation. Otherwise you may process a return upon receipt.

Loyalty Program:
Customers automatically earn 1 point per $1 spent (excluding tax and shipping).
Every 100 points = $5 discount redeemable at checkout.
Points expire after 12 months of inactivity. Points are revoked if an order is refunded.

Discounts & Promotions:
Promotional codes must be entered at checkout and cannot be applied retroactively.
Unless stated otherwise, promotions do not stack with other discounts.
If a discounted item is returned, the refund reflects the amount actually paid.

Creating an account allows order history visibility, faster checkout, and loyalty tracking.
We store only necessary personal data to fulfill orders and send transactional emails.
We do not sell customer data. See the Privacy Notice for full details.

Data Deletion:
To request deletion of your account data, email privacy@acmeshop.example. Processing may take up to 30 days.

Inventory & Backorders:
If an item becomes unavailable after purchase, we will notify you and issue a refund automatically.
We do not accept backorders unless explicitly labeled on the product page.

Sizing & Fit:
Apparel size charts are available on each product page. If unsure between sizes, choose the larger fit.
Items tried on briefly remain eligible for return if tags are intact.

Average first response time is under 24 business hours.
